## Hi there,

This is my web-portfolio

Built using next.js, it includes a bit about me, my career and the projects I have done.

It is a redesign of my first [web-portfolio](https://github.com/tomi-amao/cloud-resume-frontend)

Suggestions and feedback is very much welcomed and appreciated.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
